                    UI/UX design refers to the processes of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, which are crucial for creating user-friendly and engaging digital products. UI design focuses on the visual elements and interactivity of a product, while UX design encompasses the overall experience a user has while interacting with it. Essentially, UI is how something looks and feels, and UX is how easy and enjoyable it is to use

                    A web consultant is a technical professional who works with clients to promote the success of their business through web development and design. These consultants provide practical suggestions for improving the online presence of their clients and their businesses. They might work as a freelancer or for a web consulting firm, but it's typical for these professionals to only work with clients during a project.
